**Abstract:**   
All cells must detect and respond to changes in their environment, often
through changes in gene expression. The yeast pheromone pathway has been
extensively characterized, and is an ideal system for studying transcriptional
regulation. Here we combine computational and experimental approaches to study
transcriptional regulation mediated by Ste12, the key transcription factor in
the pheromone response. Our mathematical model is able to explain multiple
counterintuitive experimental results and led to several novel findings.
First, we found that the transcriptional repressors Dig1 and Dig2 positively
affect transcription by stabilizing Ste12. This stabilization through protein-
protein interactions creates a large pool of Ste12 that is rapidly activated
following pheromone stimulation. Second, we found that protein degradation
follows saturating kinetics, explaining the long half-life of Ste12 in mutants
expressing elevated amounts of Ste12. Finally, our model reveals a novel
mechanism for robust perfect adaptation through protein-protein interactions
that enhance complex stability. This mechanism allows the transcriptional
response to act on a shorter time scale than upstream pathway activity.
